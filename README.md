# Ring-0-Fire :fire:

Research regarding common and developing ring-0 kernel driver and their local security complications

## Research Goals

As I start this well-treaded path, I want to personally understand the rings of privellege for Microsoft Windows and be able to apply my understanding to newly developed ring-0 drivers.

### Outline

* What is the Windows Kernel?
  * Ring-0 Drivers?
* Anatomy of a kernel driver
* Past security flaws of these drivers
* Security patches/implementations to eliminate flaws
* Application of my knowledge to Vanguard, Riot Games' anti-cheat ring-0 driver
* Report on my findings
